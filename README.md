# 🚀 Mid-Level Software Engineer Mastery Journey

**Status:** In Progress (Phase 1: Runtime & Concurrency)
**Goal:** Achieve demonstrable mastery across all four domains required of a Mid-Level Software Engineer.

This repository documents my structured learning path, practice code, and major projects focused on transitioning from Junior to Mid-Level standing.

---

## 🎯 Core Domains & Progress

| Domain | Topics (Key Focus) | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Technical Mastery & Code Quality** | Runtime Environments (GIL, Event Loop, Ownership), Advanced Concurrency, Testing Doubles (Mocks, Stubs). | 🟢 Phase 1 Focus | Studying the Go Scheduler and Python's GIL impact. |
| **II. Architecture & System Design** | Idempotency, Advanced Indexing, Microservice Contracts, Scalability Principles. | 🟡 Up Next (Phase 2) | Need to practice designing an API with proper versioning. |
| **III. Tools, Infrastructure & Operations** | Advanced Git, Observability (Metrics, Tracing), Docker Optimization, CI/CD Basics. | 🟠 Integrated | Practicing `git rebase -i` on every feature branch. |
| **IV. Professionalism & Teamwork** | Code Review Excellence, Task Breakdown, Cross-Functional Communication. | 🔵 Ongoing | Documenting complex technical decisions in the LEARNING_LOG. |

## 🧠 Learning Resources & Notes

All formalized notes and concept deep dives are stored here.

*   [**NOTES/I_Technical_Mastery/**](./NOTES/I_Technical_Mastery/) - Deep dives into Python/JS/Go/Rust runtimes and concurrency.
*   [**NOTES/II_Architecture_Design/**](./NOTES/II_Architecture_Design/) - Principles of API design, data modeling, and microservice interaction.

## 🛠️ Practice Code & Demos

Isolated, self-contained examples to prove mastery of a single concept.

*   [**PRACTICE/Concurrency_Patterns/**](./PRACTICE/Concurrency_Patterns/) - Examples of channels in Go, asyncio in Python, etc.
*   [**PRACTICE/Design_Patterns/**](./PRACTICE/Design_Patterns/) - Implementations of common patterns like Strategy, Factory, and Observer.

## 🚧 Major Projects

Full-stack or distributed applications designed to integrate multiple mid-level concepts.

*   [**PROJECTS/Project_01_Distributed_System/**](./PROJECTS/Project_01_Distributed_System/) - A system using Go (performant core), Python (data processing worker), and focused on tracing. **(TBD)**

## 📜 Personal Learning Log

A diary of weekly learning, challenges faced, and successful implementations.
