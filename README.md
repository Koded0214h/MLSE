# 🚀 Mid-Level Software Engineer Mastery Journey

**Status:** In Progress (Phase 1: Deep Code Quality & Runtime)
**Goal:** Achieve demonstrable mastery across all four domains required of a Mid-Level Software Engineer.

This repository documents my structured learning path, practice code, and major projects focused on transitioning from Junior to Mid-Level standing by mastering **DSA, System Design, and Operational Excellence**.

## 🎯 Core Domains & Progress

| Domain | Topics (Key Focus) | Status | Next Major Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Technical Mastery & Code Quality** | **DSA** (Optimal Selection, Complexity $\rightarrow$ $O(T)$, $O(S)$), Advanced Concurrency, Language Performance Optimization (GIL, Event Loop), Design Patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer). | 🟢 **Phase 1 Focus** | Complete Language Deep Dive & start advanced **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra's, A*). |
| **II. Architecture & System Design** | **System Design** (Micro/Macro), **Idempotency**, Data Modeling (Normalization vs. Denormalization), Advanced Indexing, Scaling Principles (Statelessness, Horizontal Scaling). | 🟡 **Up Next (Phase 2)** | Design an API with **Versioning** and implement a **Caching Strategy** (Cache-Aside). |
| **III. Tools, Infrastructure & Operations** | Advanced Git (`rebase -i`, `bisect`), **Observability** (Metrics, Structured Logging, Tracing), Docker Optimization (Multi-stage Builds), CI/CD flow, Cloud Basics (VPC, EC2/Functions). | 🟠 **Integrated** | Practice using `git bisect` to debug a self-introduced bug; Implement distributed **Tracing** in a microservice demo. |
| **IV. Professionalism & Teamwork** | Code Review Excellence (Architectural Feedback), Task Decomposition (Epics $\rightarrow$ Stories), **General Problem Solving** (Risk Assessment, Trade-off Justification), Mentorship. | 🔵 **Ongoing** | Propose 3 viable **technical trade-offs** for a complex feature in the LEARNING_LOG. |
